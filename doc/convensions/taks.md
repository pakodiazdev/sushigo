# 📑 Instructions: How to Fill Task Template

Use the following structure to describe and track each task.
Replace placeholders with actual task details.

---

## 1. Title
- Format: **Short, action-oriented, with emoji**.
  Example:
  - `# 🐳 Initialize basic monorepo structure`
  - `# 🔒 Add authentication middleware`

---

## 2. Story
- Write in **user story format**:
  ```
  As a [role], I need [action/goal], so that [benefit].
  ```
- Keep it short and clear.
  Example:
  > As a developer, I need to set up a monorepo so that future modules can be versioned and maintained consistently.

---

## 3. Technical Tasks
- List **technical steps** as checklist items.
- Use `[ ]` for pending, `[x]` for done.
- Prefix with relevant emoji if useful:
  - 📂 for folder/file actions
  - 🔧 for implementation
  - 🧪 for testing
  - 📝 for documentation
- Example:
  ```
  - [ ] 📂 Create repository
  - [ ] 🗂️ Initialize folder structure
  - [ ] 🔧 Configure CI/CD pipeline
  ```

---

## 4. Time Tracking
### Estimates
- Define three values in hours:
  - **Optimistic:** minimum time if everything goes well.
  - **Pessimistic:** maximum time if issues appear.
  - **Tracked:** actual time spent.

### Sessions
- Log working sessions in JSON format:
  ```json
  [
    { "date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "start": "HH:MM", "end": "HH:MM" }
  ]
  ```
- Add multiple objects for multiple sessions.
